## Provide a solution for all of the fallowing 3 problems

* The files should be pushed to github and called `js-task.js` 

1. (EASY) Print integer 1 to N pattern (N is any number thats specified when run) where the next printout has the previous as a part of it

```JS
// For example, the output for N = 5 should be:
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

2. (MEDIUM) FizzBuzz: Print integers 1 to N (N is any number thats specified when run), but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by 3, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by 5, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both 3 and 5.

```JS
// For example, the output for N = 20 should be:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
```

3. (HARD) Dynamically list: create a list with the length N (N is any number thats specified when run) where the numbers in the list are ascending to the value N/2 and descending to 0:
```JS
// For example:

// if we set N = 6 the list should look like [0,1,2,2,1,0]

// if we set N = 11 the list should look like [0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,2,1.5,1,0.5,0]

```
