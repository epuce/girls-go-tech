<!-- Link states -->
<!-- :hover: For styling when a mouse pointer is over the link.
:visited: For styling when the link has been followed, as best as the browser can remember. It has limited styling ability due to security.
:link: For styling when a link has not been visited.
:active: For styling when the link is pressed (e.g. the mouse button is down or the element is being tapped on a touch screen).
:focus: Very important! Links should always have a focus style. -->
